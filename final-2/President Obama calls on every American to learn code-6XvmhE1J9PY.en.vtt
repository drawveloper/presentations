Hi everybody.

2
00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.800
This week I'm proud to join the students, teachers, businesses and

3
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.100
non-profit organizations taking big new steps to support

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.400
computer science in America's schools.

5
00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.599
Learning these skills isn't just important for your future,

6
00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.000
it's important for our country's future.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.400
If we want America to stay on the cutting edge,

8
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.300
we need young Americans, like you,

9
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.000
to master the tools and technology

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.200
that will change the way we do just about everything.

11
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.000
That's why I'm asking you to get involved.

12
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.830
Don't just buy a new video game,

13
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.000
make one.

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.400
Don't just download the latest app,

15
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.000
help design it.

16
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.800
Don't just play on your phone,

17
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.000
program it.

18
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.900
No one's born a computer scientist,

19
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.050
but with a little hard work, and some math and science,

20
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.800
just about anyone can become one.

21
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.100
This week is your chance to give it a shot.

22
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.900
And don't let anyone tell you "you can't."

23
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.039
Whether you're a young man or a young woman,

24
00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.800
whether you live in a city or a rural area,

25
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.170
computers are going to be a big part of your future.

26
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.500
And if you're willing to work and study hard,

27
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.000
that future is yours to shape.

28
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Thanks everybody!
